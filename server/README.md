# Blackjack backend

This is the backend for my blackjack game. It models the game state as a finite state machine thanks to [pytransitions](https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions) and allows clients to talk with it via websockets thanks to [python-socketio](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/python-socketio). This is still a WIP as I wrote the whole frontend and backend in a week but I am planning to add more features to the game and hopefully get rid of unncessary comments, test codes from the code base to make it more readable and beautiful.
