# Blackjack frontend

This is the frontend for my blackjack game forked from https://github.com/polivodichka/blackjack. I do not enjoy writing frontend code so I decided to modify an existing code to have a UI for my game. My initial goal is to have a working code even though it sucks. So you might see console.log's here and there. When the game has all the features I want, I will clean up the code base.

## Main functionality

- Creating a new game table or joining an existing one by ID.
- Entering the game with a specified name and balance.
- Game interface allowing unlimited amount of players to play at the same time.
- The ability to add and remove chips.
- Displaying the current game status
- Animations (keyframes and framer motion)


TODOs: 
- [ ] Ability to top up the balance
- [ ] Sound settings
- [ ] Notify certain events such as "Player joined", "Insufficient founds", "Invalid game" etc.
- [ ] Ability to chat with other players
- [ ] Ability to continue the same game when the page is refreshed
- [ ] Add a timer to make actions
